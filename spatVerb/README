spatVerb

This folder contains one MATLAB function (ISM_dis.m) and the actual spatVerb.m script, which corresponds to the main degree project
algorithm. This algorithm consists on the combination between reverb and spatialization. The reverb is generated via convolution (the 
IR calculation algorithm is based on ISM.m (located on ISM code folder)) and the spatialization, via IID and ITD concepts by considering
a "stereo listener" (two listener points on "ears") instead a mono one. Further explanation on the main research document.
